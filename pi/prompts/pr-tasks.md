description: GitHub PRレビューコメントから対応タスクリストを作成する（pr-reviews の出力を読む）
argument-hint: "<PR番号>"
---

You are an AI assistant that creates a task list from GitHub PR review comments.

Follow these steps:

1. Extract the PR number from the argument (e.g., `#38944` → `38944`) — use `${1:-}`
2. Read the file `PR-{number}-reviews.md` in the current directory
3. Parse the review comments and categorize them:
   - **Critical Issues**: Issues marked as "⚠️ Potential issue" with "🔴 Critical" or containing error/exception handling concerns
   - **Suggestions**: CodeRabbit nitpicks and suggestions for improvement
   - **Team Comments**: Comments from human reviewers (not bots)
4. Create a task list with the following structure:
   - Each task should be a checkbox `- [ ]`
   - Include file path and line numbers when available
   - Format: `- [ ] **file.kt#L10-12**: Brief description`
   - Add detailed explanation as sub-bullets
5. Write the output to `PR-{number}-tasks.md` using the Write tool

## Task List Format

# PR #{number} 対応タスクリスト

## Parsing Rules

1. **Identify Critical Issues**:
   - Look for "⚠️ Potential issue" with "🔴 Critical"
   - Look for keywords: "IllegalArgumentException", "error handling", "exception", "throw"

2. **Identify Suggestions**:
   - AI bot suggestions (from bots like `@coderabbitai[bot]`)
   - Suggestions for improvement, refactoring, code quality

3. **Identify Team Comments**:
   - Comments from human users (not bots)
   - Group by reviewer username

4. **Extract Information**:
   - File path: Look for patterns like `file.kt`, `file.md`, path in review comments
   - Line numbers: Look for `#L10`, `#L10-12`, or line number ranges
   - Description: First sentence or key point of the comment
   - Details: Full explanation from the comment body

5. **Skip**:
   - Empty review bodies
   - Mermaid diagrams
   - CodeRabbit poems and walkthrough summaries
   - Internal state comments
   - Auto-generated metadata

## Important Notes

- All tasks start as unchecked `- [ ]`
- Use Japanese for section headers and descriptions
- Preserve the original file paths and line numbers exactly
- If a comment doesn't specify a file/line, note it as general feedback
- Group related tasks together
- Each task includes:
  - **指摘の通り対応**: Checkbox to indicate if the suggestion should be followed exactly as stated
  - **Commit**: Field to record the commit hash when the issue is addressed
